## Before Starting
First of all this is a boilerplate react social and the purpose is to find the best way to implement a huge project such as social network by [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) . We learn what technology or algorithm could be better solution for our project by [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html). Please approach to this project with these ideas and if you feel that you have better solution, to our great pleasure if we could have your contribution.
  - You are the person who is new to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) and you are looking for some ideas to start [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) with some basic stuff. Also you are the fan of [React Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) I recommend you start with [React Blog Project](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-blog).
  - You are the person who has the base knowledge of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) which provided in [React Blog Project](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-blog) and you are the fan of social network projects, [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/). You are the person who love JS/JSX. [js-react-social-tutorial](https://github.com/Qolzam/js-react-social-tutorial) project will be recommended.
  - You are the fan of pure [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) with [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [InversifyJS](http://inversify.io/) IOC container and you have the knowledge enough about the stuff in [js-react-social-tutorial](https://github.com/Qolzam/js-react-social-tutorial). [Version 0.5.0 branch of react-social-network](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/v0.5) is the place you can find yourself.
  - You are in advanced level of React and you are in love with learning advanced stuff about [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) such [Async Component/Lazy loading](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#code-splitting), [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) and other cool stuff, well come you here. We are going ahead.üëç

## Built With

  * [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output.
  * [JSX/TSX](https://jsx.github.io/) This project support both *.jsx and *.tsx files. JSX is a statically-typed, object-oriented programming language designed to run on modern web browsers. Being developed at DeNA as a research project, the language has following characteristics.
  * [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) A javascript library for building user interfaces.
  * [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
  * [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) A Set of React Components that Implement Google's Material Design.
  * [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) Official React bindings for Redux.
  * [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) products like Analytics, Realtime Database, Messaging, and Crash Reporting let you move quickly and focus on your users.
  * [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, simple to test, and better at handling failures.
  * [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.
  * [React Router V4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for routing website location
  * [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS with superpowers. Sass boasts more features and abilities than any other CSS extension language out there.
  * [InversifyJS](http://inversify.io/) InversifyJS is a lightweight (4KB) inversion of control (IoC) container for TypeScript and JavaScript apps. A IoC container uses a class constructor to identify and inject its dependencies.
  * [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) Create React App is a tool built by developers at Facebook to help you build React applications. It saves you from time-consuming setup and configuration. You simply run one command and create react app sets up the tools you need to start your React project.
